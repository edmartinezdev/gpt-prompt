# ChatGPT Node.js Integration 🚀

Welcome to the ChatGPT Node.js Integration project! This project is all about connecting with the powerful ChatGPT API using Node.js and TypeScript. Whether you're a hobbyist looking to tinker with AI, or a seasoned developer aiming to incorporate ChatGPT into your tech stack, you've come to the right place! 🌟

## What This Project Does 🤖

This project sets up a simple Node.js application that:
- Sends user input to the ChatGPT model.
- Receives responses directly from ChatGPT.
- Logs the conversation to the console.

It's perfect for learning how APIs work, exploring AI-generated text, and integrating these technologies into larger projects. 📚
